# Delhi-Metro-Route-Optimisation

The problem I am working on is my take on a problem statement I found at statso. 

The dataset contains several files, as follows:

Agency: Information about the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, including name, URL, and contact details.
Calendar: Service schedules delineating the operation days (weekdays, weekends) and valid dates for these schedules.
Routes: Details of metro routes, including short and long names, type of route, and descriptions.
Shapes: Geographical coordinates of routes, providing the precise paths taken by the metro lines.
Stop Times: Timetables for each trip indicating arrival and departure times at specific stops.
Stops: Locations of metro stops, including latitude and longitude coordinates.
Trips: Information linking trips to routes, including details like trip identifiers and associated route IDs.

At the end of the project I was able to do the following:

**Morning and Evening Peaks: **
We increased the number of trips by 20%, anticipating higher demand during these hours. 
This adjustment aims to reduce overcrowding and improve passenger comfort and service reliability.

**Midday and Late Evening:**
We decreased the trips by 10%, assuming that the demand drops during these times, 
allowing for more efficient use of resources without significantly impacting service quality.

By implementing these adjustments, Delhi Metro can potentially improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction, especially during peak hours.
